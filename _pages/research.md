# Research

This group is undertaking multiple research projects in developing quantum communication devices and practical quantum memory buffers. Such innovative devices will have major implications in future quantum networks capable of many powerful operations.  The most immediate being full secure data encryption through quantum key distribution

Our long term vision for the laboratory involves contributing to the training of students and personnel with a unique quantum skill set. This means opening our lab doors to upper-year engineering projects, where students will use tools and devices that they will likely encounter as future quantum communications engineers. We believe that the field of quantum communications is quickly transitioning from a research field into an engineering discipline and that this is already creating an increasing demand for trained personnel.

### Robust Quantum Memory Systems for Real-World Deployment

Similar to a classical communication network, the transmission backbone of the quantum version will be based
on photonics and light. The major elements necessary for a practical long-distance quantum network include i) a
dependable source of light encoded with quantum information such as single photons, ii) a transmission channel
compatible with the wavelengths of the source, iii) practical and well-understood detection techniques/schemes
and iv) a robust optical quantum memory device with suficient operating characteristics. While these facets
individually require a significant amount of attention, they will ultimately need to "speak to" one another and
smoothly integrate into telecommunication systems for a real-world quantum network to be realized.

The last element listed, an optical quantum memory (QM) presents quite a challenge. Such a device is crucial to
transmit quantum light over trans-continental distances and serves as the quantum analog to classical amplifiers
used in undersea optical fibres to regenerate classical signals at intermediate stages. Any optical QM device needs
to capture, hold and release light states/photons on demand, all while preserving the quantum nature of the light
states. In other words, a QM must indiscriminately receive an arbitrary quantum state without ever knowing
what it is but, ideally, would know that `some state' is present. In the immediate future QM devices will have major implications for extending real-world
QKD through a technique called measurement device independent QKD and quantum teleportation.
However a system proven capable of wide-scale deployment remains elusive.

A promising optical QM candidate are atomic ensembles, typically the alkali metals of rubidium or cesium. The
storage occurs by conditioning the resonances of these elements to map the excitations of a weak electromagnetic
field ( s) to the collective nature of atoms in a coherent and reversible fashion. This often requires additional
control laser fields  that mediates the storage and retrieval operations. Of the first techniques shown
capable of this operation was a quantum interference effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT). This coherent, nonlinear effect allows one to modulate the refractive index and slowdown light pulses
near atomic resonance to the point of stopping them.

EIT has shown viable for storing single photons and entangled photons. Atomic ensemble-based systems can be optimized for different metrics depending
on the application Warm vapour systems hold a distinct advantage in terms of practicality, a vapour cell system operates in a temperature
controlled environment near room temperature. The simplistic, low overhead implementation in combination
with their proven QM operation make vapour cells ideal candidates for wide-scale deployment.

The remaining key piece is the engineering of these QM systems to a modular form that would be suitable for
wide-scale deployment to numerous nodes of a quantum network. This task of compacting a QM system into
a modular form suitable for operation in the field is ongoing by my collaborators at Qunnect.

### High bandwidth quantum protocols using commercial components
Data encryption and transmission with security verified by quantum mechanical laws would have implications
spanning many sectors including financial banking, national defence, online commerce and data privacy. For this
unconditional security to become a reality, a specialized encryption key verified by quantum statistics must be
shared between two separated but trusted parties (or i.e. ends of a transmission line) and is commonly known
as quantum key distribution QKD. The versatility and degrees of freedom characteristic of light has led to
numerous successful QKD implementations.

When QKD schemes are transitioned to real-world networks they will likewise need to smoothly and successfully integrate with metropolitan fibre systems, with many groups already pursuing this objective. Our group aims to develop and test quantum communication schemes that interface state-ofthe-
art telecommunication devices with quantum state measurement techniques. Specifically, commercial phase amplitude modulations have the ideal functionality for continuous variable QKD (CVQKD) encoding. This QKD method uses data encoding based on localizing electric field  fluctuations to specific phase and amplitude values. The field of a quantum state can be measured using a balanced homodyne detection (BHD) technique. Processing BHD data characterizes the quantum state in the same phase space used for telecommunications encoding.

### New species of quantum photonic devices based on silicon nitride
The bandwidth of QKD can be increased by utilizing multiple photonic degrees of freedom (DOF) just as
the telecommunications industry does (i.e. greater DOF translates to higher information capacity). Photonic
disk resonators fabricated from silicon nitride (Si3N4) are superb candidates for this DOF requirement. These
`microdisks' exhibit numerous of distinguishable yet coherent, frequency bands (frequency comb) where
every band can contain multiple bits of data. The frequency spectrum exhibited by Si3N4 can be
tailored to telecommunication wavelengths for compatibility with industry devices such as wavelength division
multiplexers for data processing.
