# Research

This group is undertaking multiple research projects in the quantum communications and quantum memory fields. 

Our long term vision for the laboratory involves contributing to the training of students and personnel with a unique quantum skill set. This means opening our lab doors to upper-year engineering projects, where students will use tools and devices that they will likely encounter as future quantum communications engineers. We believe that the field of quantum communications is quickly transitioning from a research field into an engineering discipline and that this is already creating an increasing demand for trained personnel.
