# Research

Our group focuses on several projects aimed at developing quantum communication devices and practical quantum memory buffers utilizing light. The ultimate goal is for these devices to form the building blocks of future quantum networks, capable of facilitating various powerful applications, including fully secure data encryption through quantum key distribution (QKD).

Quantum communications has reached an exciting stage, with quantum devices evolving into more robust and deployable forms. Our lab is dedicated to training and mentoring the next generation of researchers who will play vital roles in the future quantum workforce. Our projects specialize in equipping HQP with the skills and tools necessary for their roles as future quantum communications engineers.

### Robust Quantum Memory Systems for Real-World Deployment

Similar to classical communication networks, the backbone of quantum networks relies on photonics and light transmission. Key components for a practical long-distance quantum network include:

  (i)  A reliable source of light encoded with quantum information, such as single photons.
  (ii)  A transmission channel compatible with the wavelengths of the light source.
  (iii) Practical and well-understood detection techniques/schemes.
  (iv) A robust optical quantum memory device with sufficient operating characteristics.

While each of these components demands significant attention individually, they must ultimately integrate seamlessly into telecommunication systems for a real-world quantum network to materialize.

The last element mentioned, an optical quantum memory (QM), poses a considerable challenge. This device is essential for transmitting quantum light over transcontinental distances and serves as the quantum equivalent of classical amplifiers used in undersea optical fibers. An optical QM must capture, hold, and release light states/photons on demand while preserving their quantum nature. This requires the QM to receive an arbitrary quantum state without knowing its content, ideally detecting the presence of 'some state.'

In the immediate future, QM devices will significantly impact real-world QKD through techniques like measurement device-independent QKD and quantum teleportation. However, achieving a system capable of wide-scale deployment remains elusive.

A promising candidate for an optical QM is atomic ensembles, typically composed of alkali metals like rubidium or cesium. These systems store light by conditioning the resonances of these elements, mapping electromagnetic field excitations to the collective behavior of atoms in a coherent and reversible manner. This often involves additional control laser fields that mediate storage and retrieval operations.

One of the first techniques capable of this operation is a quantum interference effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT allows modulation of the refractive index, slowing down light pulses near atomic resonance to the point of stopping them.

EIT has proven effective for storing single and entangled photons. Atomic ensemble-based systems, particularly warm vapor systems, offer practical advantages due to their operation near room temperature. Their simplistic implementation and proven QM operation make them ideal for wide-scale deployment.

The remaining challenge lies in engineering QM systems into a modular form suitable for deployment across numerous nodes of a quantum network. This task is currently underway with our collaborators at Qunnect (Brooklyn, NY).

### New species of quantum photonic devices based on silicon nitride
Increasing the bandwidth of QKD can be achieved by utilizing multiple photonic degrees of freedom (DOF), similar to the telecommunications industry. Photonic disk resonators fabricated from silicon nitride (Si3N4) are excellent candidates for this purpose. These 'microdisks' exhibit numerous coherent frequency bands (frequency comb), each capable of containing multiple bits of data. The frequency spectrum of Si3N4 can be tailored to telecommunication wavelengths, ensuring compatibility with industry devices such as wavelength division multiplexers for data processing."

### High bandwidth quantum protocols using commercial components
Data encryption and transmission secured by quantum mechanical laws hold implications across various sectors, including finance, defense, e-commerce, and data privacy. Achieving unconditional security requires sharing a specialized encryption key verified by QKD.

As QKD schemes transition to real-world networks, they must seamlessly integrate with metropolitan fiber systems. Our group aims to develop and test quantum communication schemes that interface state-of-the-art telecommunication devices with quantum state measurement techniques.  Specifically, commercial phase amplitude modulations have the ideal functionality for continuous variable QKD (CVQKD) encoding. This QKD method uses data encoding based on localizing electric field fluctuations to specific phase and amplitude values. The field of a quantum state can be measured using a balanced homodyne detection (BHD) technique which processes data, characterizes the quantum state in the same phase space used for telecommunications encoding.
